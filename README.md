This is a command line tool I wrote in less than 30 mins for (what I'm pretty sure is) my niche use case of needing to find duplicate filenames in ~600GB of photos, most of which are just the RAWs straight off my camera. 

Written in python (for now) as I just needed it done quick.

Currently tested and known working on MacOS and Linux, although very likely works fine on BSD. Probably doesn't work on Windows.


I may in future port this to C and add support for find options, essentially making this "find but only for duplicates", as that was my initial intention.
