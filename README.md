This is a command line tool I wrote in less than 30 mins for (what I'm pretty sure is) my niche use case of needing to find duplicate filenames in ~600GB of photos, most of which are just the RAWs straight off my camera. 

Written in python (for now) as I just needed it done quick.

Currently only works on Linux (and maybe BSD but untested there) as it uses the "find" command which is, for some (likely pointless) reason, not the same on MacOS.
